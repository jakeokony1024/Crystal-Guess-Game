# unit-4-game


1. The first step I took was to create the HTML, I wanted to have a main container that held the crystal images, as well as the direction text and the wins, losses, and rounds.

2. The next step was to work on the logic of the game, I new that I would have to create a variable to hold the random number as well as the Math.random function to get a random number. I set     the parameters between 1 and 120. I also created variables for the wins and losses counter, this way it can be displayed on the page.
